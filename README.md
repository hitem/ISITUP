Started out with **isup.sh**, ended up with **isitup.sh**<br>
ICMP was not enough, rewrote and reused some parts, cred to gitnepal on github, pogchamp<br>

## Usage
./isitup.sh <list.txt><br>
outputs two files called validlist.txt & notvalid.txt into /tmp/ in scriptdirectory<br>


## Dependecies
Note that ive built in the installation of Hping3 and Lolcat. Remove if you have those already.
